# chrome_extension  
A skeleton for building google chrome extension for streamer  
  
##HOW IT WORKS :  
change in live_alert/ressources/ the different images  
  
then open app.js :  
and change at every line where "change HERE" is written  

then open chrome, type "chrome://extensions"  
then click on "package extension" then select the folder of the application  
it will create a ".crx" file  
  
you need to click on this file and drop it on the page already open 'chrome://extensions' then select install  
  
and you good to go :)
